.B Format of the format String.
.RS
The format string is a character string that may begin or end in it's initial shift state, if any. It is composed of zero or more directives. These are:
.br
.B oridnary characters that are not ( % ) \- copied to the system unchanged,
.br
.B conversion specifications \- result in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
.br

.B Conversion Specifications
are introduced using the character
.I %
and end with a
.B conversion specifier.
.PP
The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier. By default, the arguments are used in the order given an each conversion specifier asks for the next argument. It is an error if insufficiently many arguments are given.
